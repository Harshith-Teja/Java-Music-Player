Java Music Player that connects people with similar music tastes using socket programming

Java Music Player is a classic music player that allows users to play, pause and switch between
music. Besides the music player connects various people with similar tastes in music. It is an
application of multiple layers of computer networks that explores various operations and
dimensions from playing an audio file to texting strangers who have familiar music taste like you
with the help of client-server architecture. This music player acts as an icebreaker among people.
It doesnâ€™t allow you to rack your brain on how to start a conversation with a stranger. Because as
soon as a user gets connected to the server, the server stores the playlist of that user and it scans
the playlist of a user against every other user connected to the server at that particular time and
provides a percentage match in music taste from one user to all other users connected to the
server. A user can use it as a starter for a conversation with someone who is completely new to
them.
